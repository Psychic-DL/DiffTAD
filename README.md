# ðŸŽ¯ Highlights
- A new framework for vehicle trajectory anomaly detection that formalizes this problem as a noisy-to-normal paradigm.
- Reconstructing near-normal trajectories from trajectories corrupted by Gaussian noise and detecting anomalies by comparing the differences between the query trajectories and their reconstructions.
- Transformer-based temporal and spatial encoders are integrated to model the temporal dependencies and spatial interactions of vehicles in the diffusion model.
- The interval sampling strategy accelerates the inference process of diffusion models.
